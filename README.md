# Hi there, I'm Zhu Weijie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** based in Singapore with over a decade of experience architecting and developing robust, scalable, and high-performance software solutions. 

My core expertise lies in **Python** and **C++** for backend systems, API development, and full-stack applications. I'm passionate about leveraging modern technologies and best practices â€“ including **microservices, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Agile methodologies** â€“ to solve complex problems and deliver impactful products.

I look for opportunities to build impactful products and solve complex problems.

*   **[AuraClinicalAnalytics: An AI-powered, event-driven system for real-time patient risk prediction](https://github.com/zhu-weijie/aura-clinical-analytics)**
    * AURA is a comprehensive, event-driven AI system built to demonstrate a realistic healthcare use case. It simulates a stream of clinical data, processes it through a Kafka pipeline, makes predictions using both a traditional ML model and a generative LLM, and visualizes the results in a monitoring dashboard.

*   **[MemexAI: An AI research assistant with persistent memory](https://github.com/zhu-weijie/memex-ai)**
    * A command-line research assistant that overcomes the limitations of stateless chatbots. It uses a persistent SQLite backend to remember your conversation history across sessions and an in-memory store to recall key facts during a live session.

*   **[LanggraphAutopilot: A LangGraph-based autonomous agent framework](https://github.com/zhu-weijie/langgraph-autopilot)**
    * An autonomous software engineering agent that reads GitHub issues, analyzes codebases, and writes and submits code changes to resolve them.

*   **[EmbeddingStudio: A cloud-native FastAPI application for text processing and semantic search, featuring AWS Bedrock for embedding generation.](https://github.com/zhu-weijie/embedding-studio-api)**
    * A cloud-native FastAPI application for text processing and semantic search, featuring AWS Bedrock for embedding generation. It is deployed on AWS ECS with a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and Terraform for Infrastructure as Code.


### MLOps

*   **[InferNet: Dockerized Image Classification API & MLOps Demo](https://github.com/zhu-weijie/infer-net)**
    * A machine learning application serving an image classification model (TensorFlow/Keras) via a Python (FastAPI) RESTful API, containerized with Docker. Highlights experience with ML model deployment, API development for inference, and MLOps principles.

*   **[CreatorPulse: A MLOps platform for AI-powered content creation](https://github.com/zhu-weijie/creator-pulse)**
    * An end-to-end MLOps project for real-time YouTube sentiment analysis. Powers a Chrome Extension via a Flask API, deployed on AWS with full CI/CD.

### Other
