# Hi there, I'm Zhu Weijie ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** based in Singapore with over a decade of experience architecting and developing robust, scalable, and high-performance software solutions. 

My core expertise lies in **Python** and **C++** for backend systems, API development, and full-stack applications. I'm passionate about leveraging modern technologies and best practices â€“ including **microservices, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Agile methodologies** â€“ to solve complex problems and deliver impactful products.

Throughout my career, I have successfully led Agile engineering teams and managed the complete software development lifecycle, from architecting scalable systems to mentoring engineers and driving project delivery.

I look for opportunities to build impactful products and solve complex problems.
