I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** based in Singapore with over a decade of experience architecting and developing robust, scalable, and high-performance software solutions. 

My core expertise lies in **Python** and **C++** for backend systems, API development, and full-stack applications. I'm passionate about leveraging modern technologies and best practices ‚Äì including **microservices, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, and Agile methodologies** ‚Äì to solve complex problems and deliver impactful products.

I particularly enjoy working on data-intensive applications and systems that support AI/ML workflows.
